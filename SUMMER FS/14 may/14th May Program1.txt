Given a string S, find length of the longest substring with all distinct characters.  

For example, for input "abca", the output is 3 as "abc" is the longest substring with all distinct characters.

Assume the input consists of only lower case alphabets 

Input:
The first line of each test case is String str.

Output:
Print length of substring with maximum number of distinct characters.
Note: The output substring should have all distinct characters.


Example:
input = abababcdefababcdab
output = 6

input = system
output = 5


back end test cases
case = 1
input =abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxya
output = 25

case = 2
input = hhhh
output = 1

case = 3
input = abcd
output = 4

case = 4
input = computer
output = 8
