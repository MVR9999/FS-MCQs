You are given an array A of size N. 
Replace every element with the next greatest element (greatest element on its right side) in the array. 
Also, since there is no element next to the last element, replace it with -1.

Input:
Each testcase contains two lines of input. 
The first line is N, the size of tha array. 
The second line contains N space separated integers.

Output:
For each testcase, print the modified array.

input = 6
16 17 4 3 5 2
output = 17 5 5 5 2 -1

Explanation:
Testcase1: For 16 the greatest element on its right is 17. 
For 17 it's 5. 
For 4 it's 5. 
For 3 it's 5. 
For 5 it's 2. 
For 2 it's -1(no element to its right). 
So the answer is 17 5 5 5 2 -1


 input = 4
2 3 1 9
output =
9 9 9 -1


back end test cases

case = 1
input = 5
1 2 3 4 5
output = 5 5 5 5 -1

case = 2
input = 5
6 6 6 6 6
output = 6 6 6 6 -1

case = 3
input = 8
10 8 7 5 4 3 2 20
output = 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 -1

case = 4
input = 8
10 8 7 5 4 3 2 1
output = 8 7 5 4 3 2 1 -1
