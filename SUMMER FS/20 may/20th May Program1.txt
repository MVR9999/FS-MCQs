Given two strings, 
check whether these strings are meta strings or not. 
Meta strings are the strings which can be made equal by exactly one swap in any of the strings. 

Equal string are not considered here as Meta strings.

if the strings are meta strings print Yes else print No 

Examples:

Input = goods
doogs
Output = Yes

By just swapping 'd' and 'g' in any of string, 
both will become same.

Input  = rsting
string
Output = No

back end test cases

case = 1
input = Converse
Conserve
output = Yes

case = 2
input = rsting
string
output = No

case = 3
input = abca
abda
output = No

case = 4
input = hello
holle
output = Yes
