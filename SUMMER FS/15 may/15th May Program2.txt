You are given an array A of size N. You need to print the total count of sub-arrays having their sum equal to 0

Input:
First line of each test case contains an Integer N denoting the size of the array, and the second line contains N space separated integers.

Output:
For each test case, in a new line, print the total number of subarrays whose sum is equal to 0.
if no subarrays are found print 0

input = 6
0 0 5 5 0 0
output = 6

Explanation:
Testcase 1: There are 6 subarrays present whose sum is zero. The starting and ending indices are:
(0,0) (1,1) (0,1) (4,4) (5,5) (4,5)


input = 10
6  -1 -3 4 -2 2 4 6 -12 -7
output = 4

Explanation:
Testcase 2: There are 4 subarrays present whose sum is zero. The starting and ending indices are:
(1,3) (4,5) (1,5) (5,8)


back end test cases
case = 1
input = 4
2 2 2 2
output = 0

case = 2
input = 10
6  -1 -3 4 -2 2 4 6 -12 -7
output = 4

case = 3
input = 6
0 0 5 5 0 0
output = 6

case = 4
input = 6
9 -4 -5 -9 -8 -1
output = 1
