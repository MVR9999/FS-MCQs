Given an input stream of n integers, find the kth largest element for each element in the stream.

Input:
 The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers k and n . 
 Then in the next line are n space separated values of the array.

Output:
print the space separated values denoting the kth largest element at each insertion,
if the kth largest element at a particular insertion in the stream doesn't exist print -1.


input =
4 6
1 2 3 4 5 6
output = -1 -1 -1 1 2 3

Explanation:
Testcase1:
k = 4
For 1, the 4th largest element doesn't exist so we print -1.
For 2, the 4th largest element doesn't exist so we print -1.
For 3, the 4th largest element doesn't exist so we print -1.
For 4, the 4th largest element is 1 {1, 2, 3, 4}
For 5, the 4th largest element is 2 {2, 3, 4 ,5}
for 6, the 4th largest element is 3 {3, 4, 5}



input = 
1 2
3 4
output = 3 4 


back end test cases

case = 1
input =
4 6
1 2 3 4 5 6
output = -1 -1 -1 1 2 3

case = 2
input = 
1 2
3 4
output = 3 4 

case = 3
input = 4 4
1 2 3 4
output = -1 -1 -1 1

case = 4
input = 3 6
1 2 4 5 8 9
output = -1 -1 1 2 4 5
