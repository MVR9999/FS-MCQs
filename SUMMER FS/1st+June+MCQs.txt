1)

Consider the C function given below. 

Assume that the array listA contains n (> 0) elements, sorted in ascending order.

int ProcessArray(int *listA, int x, int n) 
{ 
    int i, j, k; 
    i = 0; 
    j = n-1; 
    do
    { 
        k = (i+j)/2; 
        if (x <= listA[k]) 
            j = k-1; 
        if (listA[k] <= x) 
            i = k+1; 
    } 
    while (i <= j); 
    if (listA[k] == x) 
        return(k); 
    else
        return -1; 
} 

Which one of the following statements about the function ProcessArray is CORRECT?

(A) It will run into an infinite loop when x is not in listA.
(B) It is an implementation of binary search.
(C) It will always find the maximum element in listA.
(D) It will return âˆ’1 even when x is present in listA.











Answer: (B)



2)

What does the following function print for n = 25?

void fun(int n) 
{ 
  if (n == 0) 
    return; 
  
  printf("%d", n%2); 
  fun(n/2); 
}   

(A) 11001
(B) 10011
(C) 11111
(D) 00000









Answer: (B)



3)

What is the return value of following function for arr[] = {9, 12, 2, 11, 2, 2, 10, 9, 12, 10, 9, 11, 2} and n is size of this array.

int fun(int arr[], int n) 
{ 
    int x = arr[0]; 
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) 
        x = x ^ arr[i]; 
    return x; 
} 

(A) 0
(B) 9
(C) 12
(D) 2











Answer: (B)

Explanation: Note that 9 is the only element with odd occurrences, all other elements have even occurrences.

If the input array has all elements with even occurrences except one, then the function returns the only element with odd occurrences. 
Note that XORing an element with itself results 0 and XOR of 0 with a number x is equal to x.



4)

Consider a sorted array of n numbers. 
What would be the time complexity of the best known algorithm to find a pair ‘a’ and ‘b’ such that |a-b| = k , k being a positive integer.


(A) O(n)
(B) O(n log n)
(C) O(n ^ 2)
(D) O(log n)










Answer: (A)


Explanation: 
Just maintain two pointers at the start and accordingly increment one of them depending upon whether difference is less than or greater than k. 
Just a single pass is required so the answer is O(n).



5)Which of the following sorting algorithms in its typical implementation gives best performance when applied on an array 
which is sorted or almost sorted (maximum 1 or two elements are misplaced).


(A) Quick Sort
(B) Heap Sort
(C) Merge Sort
(D) Insertion Sort









Answer: (D)

Explanation: Insertion sort takes linear time when input array is sorted or almost sorted (maximum 1 or 2 elements are misplaced).




6)
#include<iostream> 
using namespace std; 
  
class Point { 
private: 
  int x, y; 
public: 
  Point() : x(0), y(0) { } 
  Point& operator()(int dx, int dy); 
  void show() {cout << "x = " << x << ", y = " << y; } 
}; 
  
Point& Point::operator()(int dx, int dy) 
{ 
    x = dx; 
    y = dy; 
    return *this; 
} 
  
int main() 
{ 
  Point pt; 
  pt(3, 2); 
  pt.show(); 
  return 0; 
} 

(A) x = 3, y = 2
(B) Compiler Error
(C) x = 2, y = 3
(D) None of these


Answer: (A)

Explanation: This a simple example of function call operator overloading.

The function call operator, when overloaded, does not modify how functions are called. 
Rather, it modifies how the operator is to be interpreted when applied to objects of a given type.



7)Which of the following in Object Oriented Programming is supported by Function overloading and default arguments features of C++.

(A) Inheritance
(B) Polymorphism
(C) Encapsulation
(D) None of the above



















Answer: (B)

(A) Only 1

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Test obj = new Test();
        obj.set(20);
        obj.get();
    }
}

A) a = 10
B) a = 20
C) Compilation error
D) None of these













Ans- C


13)A relational database contains two tables student and department in which 

student table has columns  roll_no, name and dept_id and 
department table has columns dept_id and dept_name. 

The following insert statements were executed successfully to populate the empty tables:

Insert into department values (1, 'Mathematics')
Insert into department values (2, 'Physics')
Insert into student values (l, 'Navin', 1)
Insert into student values (2, 'Mukesh', 2)
Insert into student values (3, 'Gita', 1) 

How many rows and columns will be retrieved by the following SQL statement?

Select * from student, department

(A) 0 row and 4 columns
(B) 3 rows and 4 columns
(C) 3 rows and 5 columns
(D) 6 rows and 5 columns


Explanation: Simple,Cartesian product of two tables will result

Rows = 3*2 = 6 
Columns = 3+2 = 5 





Option (D) is correct.



14)Database table by name Loan_Records is given below.

Borrower    Bank_Manager   Loan_Amount
 Ramesh      Sunderajan     10000.00
 Suresh      Ramgopal       5000.00
 Mahesh      Sunderajan     7000.00

What is the output of the following SQL query?

SELECT Count(*) 
FROM  ( ( SELECT Borrower, Bank_Manager 
          FROM Loan_Records) AS S 
          NATURAL JOIN ( SELECT Bank_Manager, Loan_Amount 
                         FROM Loan_Records) AS T );

(A) 3
(B) 9
(C) 5
(D) 6






Answer: (C)

Following will be contents of temporary table S

Borrower    Bank_Manager
--------------------------
 Ramesh      Sunderajan
 Suresh      Ramgopal
 Mahesh      Sunderajan

Following will be contents of temporary table T


Bank_Manager   Loan_Amount
---------------------------
Sunderajan      10000.00
Ramgopal        5000.00
Sunderajan      7000.00

Following will be the result of natural join of above two tables. 
The key thing to note is that the natural join happens on column name with same name which is 
Bank_Manager in the above example. Sunderajan appears two times in Bank_Manager column, 
so their will be four entries with Bank_Manager as Sunderajan

Borrower  Bank_Manager   Load_Amount
------------------------------------
Ramesh    Sunderajan     10000.00
Ramesh    Sunderajan     7000.00
Suresh    Ramgopal       5000.00
Mahesh    Sunderajan     10000.00
Mahesh    Sunderajan     7000.00




15)

Consider a database table T containing two columns X and Y each of type integer. 

After the creation of the table, one record (X=1, Y=1) is inserted in the table.

Let MX and My denote the respective maximum values of X and Y among all records in the table at any point in time.
Using MX and MY, new records are inserted in the table 128 times with X and Y values being MX+1, 2*MY+1 respectively. 
It may be noted that each time after the insertion, values of MX and MY change. 
What will be the output of the following SQL query after the steps mentioned above are carried out?

SELECT Y FROM T WHERE X=7;

(A) 127
(B) 255
(C) 129
(D) 257







Answer (A)

 X    Y
-------
 1    1
 2    3
 3    7
 4    15
 5    31
 6    63
 7   127
 ......

16)Consider the following relation:

Works (emp_name, company_name, salary)

Here, emp_name is primary key.
Consider the following SQL query

Select emp_name
From works T
where salary > (select avg (salary)
                from works S
                where T.company _ name = S.company _ name)

The above query is for following :

(A) Find the highest paid employee who earns more than the average salary of all employees of his company.
(B) Find the highest paid employee who earns more than the average salary of all the employees of all the companies.
(C) Find all employees who earn more than the average salary of all employees of all the companies.
(D) Find all employees who earn more than the average salary of all employees of their company.
