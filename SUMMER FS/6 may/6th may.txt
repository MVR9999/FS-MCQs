program-1

You have three stacks of cylinders where each cylinder has the same diameter, but they may vary in height.
You can change the height of a stack by removing and discarding its topmost cylinder any number of times.

Find the maximum possible height of the stacks such that all of the stacks are exactly the same height. 
This means you must remove zero or more cylinders from the top of zero or more of the three stacks until 
they're all the same height, then print the height. 
The removals must be performed in such a way as to maximize the height.

Note: An empty stack is still a stack.


first line contains three space-separated integers n1,n2,n3 describing the respective number of cylinders in stacks 1, 2, and 3. The subsequent lines describe the respective heights of each cylinder in a stack from top to bottom:

Sample Input
------------
5 3 4
3 2 1 1 1
4 3 2
1 1 4 1

Sample Output
-------------
5

initially , the stack look like this


3      4    1
2      3    1
1      2    4
1           1    
1

Observe that the three stacks are not all the same height. To make all stacks of equal height, we remove the first cylinder from stacks 1 and 2, and then remove the top two cylinders from stack3  (shown below).

stack1: 8-3=5
stack2: 9-4=5
stack3: 7-1-1=5

All three stacks now have height=5. Thus, we print 5 as our answer.

Solve a given equation and return the value of x in the form of string "x=#value". 
 The equation contains only '+', '-' operation, the variable x and its coefficient.

If there is no solution for the equation, return "No solution".

If there are infinite solutions for the equation, return "Infinite solutions".

If there is exactly one solution for the equation, we ensure that the value of x is an integer.

input =x+5-3+x=6+x-2
output ="x=2"

input =x=x
output ="Infinite solutions"

output ="x=0"

program-3

The set S originally contains numbers from 1 to n. But unfortunately, due to the data error, one of the numbers in the set got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.

Given an array nums representing the data status of this set after the error. Your task is to firstly find the number occurs twice and then find the number that is missing. Return them in the form of an array.

Example 1:
input =4
1 2 2 4
output =2 3

input =5
5 4 3 1 1
output =1 2


input =6
6 5 4 3 2 2
output =
2 1

input =10
10 1 9 2 8 5 7 4 6 5
output =5 3
