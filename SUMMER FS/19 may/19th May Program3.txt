Longest Mountain Subarray

    Given an array arr[] with N elements, find out the longest sub-array which has the shape of a mountain.

    A mountain sub-array consists of elements that are initially in ascending order until a peak element is reached and beyond 
    the peak element all other elements of the sub-array are in decreasing order.

     If the array contains more than one Longest Mountains Subarrays then print the Subrrays with maximum size 
      
      If the array doesn't contain any Longest Mountain Subarrays print 0

    The first line of input contains the size of the array followed by array elements 
    

    input = 13 
    1 3 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 8 7 6 5
    output = 11
    
    Explanation:
    There are two sub-arrays that can be considered as mountain sub-arrays. 
    The first one is from index 0 – 2 (3 elements) and next one is from index 2 – 12 (11 elements).  
    As 11 > 2, our answer is 11.
 

    input = 3
    2 2 2
    output = 0
    Explanation:
    No sub-array exists that shows the behavior of a mountain sub-array.

    input = 4
    1 2 4 3
    output = 4
