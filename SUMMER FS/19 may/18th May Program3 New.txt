Find the length of largest subarray in which all elements are Autobiographical Numbers

 Given an array arr[] of integers, our task is to find the length of the largest subarray such that all the elements of the sub-array are Autobiographical Number.

    An Autobiographical Number is a number such that the first digit of it counts how many zeroes are there in it, 
    the second digit counts how many ones are there and so on.
    For example, 21200 has 2 zero, 1 one, 2 two and 0 three and 0 four. 

the first line of input contains the size of array followed by array elements 


    input = 5 
    21200 1  1303 1210 2020
    output = 2
    
    Explanation:
    Maximum length of subarray with all numbers as Autobiographical Number is {1210, 2020}.

    input = 6
    100 200 300 400 1200 500
    output = 0
    
    Explanation:
    None of them are Autobiographical Number.
