You are working at the cash counter at a fun-fair, and you have different types
of coins available to you in infinite quantities. 

The value of each coin is already given. 

Can you determine the number of ways of making change for a particular number 
of units using the given types of coins?

The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective
values of n and m, where:
n is the number of units
m is the number of coin types

The second line contains m space-separated integers describing the respective
values of each coin type : 
the list of distinct coins available in infinite amounts

input = 
4 3 
8 3 1 2

Explanation
For example, if you have 4 types of coins, and the value of each type is given as 
8,3,1,2 respectively, you can make change for 3 units in three ways: {1,1,1},{1,2} and {3}.

Note - If you are not making any change print 0

input = 
5 4
2 4 6 8
output = 0
