Minimum number of bracket reversals needed to make an expression balanced

Given an expression with only ‘}’ and ‘{‘. The expression may not be balanced. 
Find minimum number of bracket reversals to make the expression balanced.

Examples:

input = }{
output = 2

We need to change '}' to '{' and '{' to
'}' so that the expression becomes balanced, 
the balanced expression is '{}'

input  = {{{
output = -1

Explanation - Can't be made balanced using reversals

input = {{{{
output = 2 

input = {{{{}}
output = 1 

input = }{{}}{{{
output = 3



back end test cases
case = 1
input = {{{{
output = 2 

case = 2
input = {{{{}}
output = 1 

case = 3
input = }{{}}{{{
output = 3

case = 4
input  = {{{
output = -1
