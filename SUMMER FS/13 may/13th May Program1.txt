Given an unsorted array of size N. Find the first element in array such that all of its left elements are smaller and all right elements to it are greater than it.

Note: Left and right side elements can be equal to required element. And extreme elements cannot be required element.

Input:
First line of each test case contains an Integer N denoting size of array and the second line contains N space separated array elements.

Output:
For each test case, in a new line print the required element. If no such element present in array then print -1.

Example:

input = 4
4 2 5 7
output = 5

input = 3
11 9 12
output = -1

input = 6
4 3 2 7 8 9
output = 7





back end test cases
case = 1
input = 5
1 2 3 4 5
output = 2

case = 2
input = 6
6
1 8 9 7 4 5
output = -1

case = 3
input = 3
11 9 12
output = -1

case = 4
input = 6
4 3 2 7 8 9
output = 7
