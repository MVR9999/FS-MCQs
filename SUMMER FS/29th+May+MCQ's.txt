5)

Consider the following pseudo code. Assume that IntQueue is an integer queue. 
What does the function fun do?

void fun(int n) 
{ 
    IntQueue q = new IntQueue(); 
    q.enqueue(0); 
    q.enqueue(1); 
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
    { 
        int a = q.dequeue(); 
        int b = q.dequeue(); 
        q.enqueue(b); 
        q.enqueue(a + b); 
        print(a); 
    } 
} 

(A) Prints numbers from 0 to n-1
(B) Prints numbers from n-1 to 0
(C) Prints first n Fibonacci numbers
(D) Prints first n Fibonacci numbers in reverse order.


Answer: (C)

Explanation: 
The function prints first n Fibonacci Numbers. 
Note that 0 and 1 are initially there in q. 
In every iteration of loop sum of the two queue items is enqueued and the front item is dequeued.

#include <stdio.h> 
  
  int main (void) 
  { 
  int shifty; 
  shifty = 0570; 
  shifty = shifty >>4; 
  shifty = shifty <<6; 
  printf("the value of shifty is %o",shifty); 
  } 

(A) the value of shifty is 15c0
(B) the value of shifty is 4300
(C) the value of shifty is 5700
(D) the value of shifty is 2700


Answer: (D)

Explanation: Given, shifty = 0570; here shifty is a octal number as it starts with 0.

(0570)8 = (000 101 111 000)2

Right shift by 4 places:


shifty = shifty >>4;
shifty = (000 000 010 111)2

Left shift by 6 places:

shifty = shifty <<6
shifty = (010 111 000 000)2
       = (2700)8

So, option (D) is correct.

4:
5: if (time) {
6:
7: }
8: System.out.println(result);
9:
10: }
11: }

A. If String result = "done"; is inserted on line 2, the code will compile.
B. If String result = "done"; is inserted on line 4, the code will compile.
C. If String result = "done"; is inserted on line 6, the code will compile.
D. If String result = "done"; is inserted on line 9, the code will compile.
E. None of the above changes will make the code compile.

Given:
4. class Announce {
5. public static void main(String[] args) {
6. for(int __x = 0; __x < 3; __x++) ;
7. int #lb = 7;
8. long [] x [5];
9. Boolean []ba[];
10. enum Traffic { RED, YELLOW, GREEN };
11. }
12. }

What is the result? (Choose all that apply.)
A. Compilation succeeds
B. Compilation fails with an error on line 6
C. Compilation fails with an error on line 7
D. Compilation fails with an error on line 8
E. Compilation fails with an error on line 9
F. Compilation fails with an error on line 10

Answer:
C, D, and F are correct. Variable names cannot begin with a #, 
an array declaration can’t include a size without an instantiation, and 
enums can’t be declared within a method.
A, B, and E are incorrect based on the above information. 



14)

Given:
3. public class TestDays {
4. public enum Days { MON, TUE, WED };
5. public static void main(String[] args) {
6. for(Days d : Days.values() )
7. ;
8. Days [] d2 = Days.values();
9. System.out.println(d2[2]);
10. }
11. }

A. TUE
B. WED
C. The output is unpredictable
D. Compilation fails due to an error on line 4
E. Compilation fails due to an error on line 6
F. Compilation fails due to an error on line 8
G. Compilation fails due to an error on line 9


Answer:
B is correct. Every enum comes with a static values() method that returns an array
of the enum's values, in the order in which they are declared in the enum.

A, C, D, E, F, and G are incorrect based on the above information.
