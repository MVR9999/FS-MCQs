Given a matrix , return the smallest common element in all rows.

If there is no common element, return -1.

program-2

You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend: You write 
down a number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. Each time your 
friend makes a guess, you provide a hint that indicates how many digits in said
guess match your secret number exactly in both digit and position (called "bulls")
and how many digits match the secret number but locate in the wrong position 
(called "cows"). Your friend will use successive guesses and hints to eventually
derive the secret number.

Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend's 
guess, use B to indicate the bulls and C to indicate the cows. 

Please note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate 
digits.

Example 1:

input =
1807
7810
output =1B3C


secret = 1807, guess = 7810
Explanation: 1 bull and 3 cows. The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.
Output: "1B3C"


Example 2:
input =
1123
0111
output =1B1C



Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"

Output: "1A1B"

Explanation: The 1st 1 in friend's guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd 1 is a cow.
Note: You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only contain
digits, and their lengths are always equal.

//backend testcases:
case = 1
input =
1807
7810
output =1B3C
case = 2
input =
1123
0111
output =1B1C
case = 3
input =
12345
54321
output =
1B4C
case = 4
input =

5678
output =0B0C


program-3

Write a function to determine if a number is strobogrammatic. The number is 
represented as a string.

A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 
degrees (looked at upside down).

input =69
output =true

input =88
output =true


input =962
output =false

input =8888
output =true
